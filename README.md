\***\* WORKING LOG \*\***
3/21/24 {
    I am current working in the FactoryPattern.js file. I am making sure all the functions are working properly. 
        Finished { CheckVerify(), ValidateAccount() : documention and bugcheck... }
        * Use the promise object for async operations
    
    After : connect it to the ModelManager and create the controller for that side of it
}
3/22/24 {
    - I'm pretty much done with the factoryPatter.js. I moved the functions i had in there into ModelManager.js just so that script wouldn't have to keep on going into factoryPatter.js in order to use them. Plus the controller (ModelManager.js) would put better use of them. I just wanted the Creation of the user to be in the FactoryPatter.js
    
    Currently working on: Login class, Im almost done with it just need to test and debug it.
}
3/25/24 {
    - Finished the the the Control/ModelManager.js. The Login/SignUp/VerifyEmail are done. Now just need to work on the view part of it.
